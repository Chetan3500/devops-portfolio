# DevOps Portfolio

This repository is a **versioned engineering log** documenting how my DevOps skills are built, tested, and validated on real systems.

It is not a collection of notes or tutorials.
Every skill here is demonstrated through **working configurations, command execution, automation, and recorded demos**.

---

## What this repository represents

This repository contains my **DevOps skill execution history**.

> _Execution history_ means that each capability is shown through real work:
> infrastructure setup, system configuration, troubleshooting, and iteration —
> not just explanations or screenshots.

Everything in this repository is:

- **Versioned**
  Progression over time is preserved to show how skills evolved.

- **Demo-backed**
  Each topic includes links to recorded demonstrations.

- **Based on real remote systems**
  No mock environments or local-only setups.

- **Structured as `Epics → Work → Versions`**
  Organized to reflect real-world engineering workflows.

## Documentation structure

Inside `docs/`, each Epic is organized consistently to make review and navigation straightforward.

Each Epic contains:

- **README.md**
  A summary of what I can currently do in that domain.

- **Versioned folders**
  A chronological record of how the skill was learned, practiced, and refined.

- **YouTube demo links**
  Recorded proof of execution and results.

> A reviewer can start with any Epic README to understand current capability,
> then explore version folders to see the learning and engineering process.

## Epics

Epics represent long-term DevOps domains that are developed incrementally and maintained over time.

[Linux](docs/linux/) | [Git and Github](./docs/git-and-github/) | Networking | AWS | CI/CD | Docker | Kubernets | IaC | Monitoring

---

## Currently working on

The following Epics are under active development and updated regularly:

- [Linux](docs/linux/)
- [Git and Github](./docs/git-and-github/)

> Completed Epics remain versioned and documented, but are marked as stable.

## How to evaluate this portfolio

1. Choose an Epic
2. Read the Epic README to understand current capability
3. Review version folders to see progression and decision-making
4. Watch linked demos for execution proof
