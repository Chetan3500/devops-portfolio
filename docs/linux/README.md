# Linux — DevOps Foundations

This directory tracks my **Linux operational skills** developed for real DevOps work.

Linux is treated here not as a theory subject, but as an **operating environment** used to run:

- cloud servers
- containers
- CI/CD pipelines
- production workloads

Everything here is built and validated on **remote Linux hosts via SSH**.

## How Linux is learned here

Linux is developed through **Work Cards** — focused, versioned capability units.

Each work card:

- targets one operational skill
- evolves through versions (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0…)
- is validated through demos
- is documented with logs and artifacts

This allows Linux skills to grow in a **controlled, traceable way**, just like real engineering systems.

## Work Cards

| Work Card                                                         | Current Level | Description                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**Filesystem & Navigation**](./filesystem-navigation/)           | v1.1          | Moving, inspecting, and navigating Linux filesystems on remote hosts |
| [**File & Directory Operations**](./file-directories-operations/) | v1.1          | Creating, copying, moving, deleting, and organizing files safely     |
| **Permissions & Ownership**                                       | Planned       | Controlling who can access and modify files                          |
| **Processes & Services**                                          | Planned       | Managing running applications and services                           |
| **Logs & Troubleshooting**                                        | Planned       | Finding and analyzing failures                                       |

Each work card folder contains:

- a `README.md` (what this skill is)
- version folders (`v1.0`, `v1.1`, etc.)
- demo links
- worklogs and artifacts

## Why this matters for DevOps

DevOps engineers do not “know Linux” in general.
They use Linux to:

- debug production systems
- deploy applications
- run automation
- investigate failures

This repository proves I can do exactly that — with **real execution and versioned evidence**.

> Work Cards are how that runtime is mastered.**
