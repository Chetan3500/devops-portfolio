# File & Directory Operations — v1.1

> Second iteration of this workcard.

This iteration focuses on **safe and efficient bulk file operations** on a remote Linux system.

These capabilities are critical for:

- cleaning up failed deployments
- managing build artifacts
- maintaining application directories
- operating production-like servers without mistakes

---

## Focus

Safe and efficient file and directory manipulation on a remote Linux host via SSH.

---

## What this iteration covers

- Using wildcards to operate on multiple files
- Performing safe (confirm-before-delete) operations
- Removing non-empty directories
- Copying entire directory trees
- Verifying files before moving or deleting
- Cleaning up broken or unused application files

---

## Outcome

This iteration improved my ability to:

- Manage multiple files safely using wildcards
- Prevent accidental deletions with confirmation flags
- Remove directories that contain files
- Copy directory structures reliably
- Clean up messy or broken application folders
- Operate with confidence on real remote systems

### Next iteration

**v2.0 — Environment-Aware File Operations (Cloud & Containers)**
_(Locked until Cloud backlog begins.)_
