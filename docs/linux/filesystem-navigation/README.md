# Linux Filesystem Navigation via SSH — v1.1

> Previous iteration: [v1.0](https://github.com/Chetan3500/devops-portfolio/blob/Linux-v1.0-artifact/docs/linux/filesystem-navigation/README.md)

## Focus

Efficiency and safety upgrade.

## What I learned

- Preserve navigation context using directory stacks
- Switch between multiple directories without losing orientation
- Visualize deep directory structures before interacting with them
- Safely inspect unknown files without executing or modifying them
